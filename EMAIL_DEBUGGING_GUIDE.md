# 🔧 Email Delivery Debugging Guide

## 🚨 **Issue Analysis**

Since you have both `RESEND_API_KEY` and `INNGEST` properly configured but emails aren't being delivered, the issue is likely in the **email flow
logic** or **Inngest workflow execution**.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**

The problem is in the registration flow:

```typescript
// Current flow (PROBLEMATIC):
1. Try Inngest email → Might fail silently
2. Only send fallback if Inngest is NOT configured
3. Since Inngest IS configured → No fallback email sent
```

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Dual Email Sending**

-   ✅ **Always send fallback email** regardless of Inngest status
-   ✅ **Enhanced logging** for both Inngest and Resend
-   ✅ **Better error handling** for both paths

### **2. Comprehensive Debugging**

-   ✅ **Inngest event logging** with configuration details
-   ✅ **Email sending logging** with detailed status
-   ✅ **Test email endpoint** for direct Resend testing

### **3. Test Email Endpoint**

-   ✅ **Direct Resend testing** bypassing Inngest
-   ✅ **Immediate feedback** on email delivery
-   ✅ **Token generation** for testing verification

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **1. Deploy the Fixes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🔧 Fix email delivery with dual sending and enhanced debugging

- Always send fallback email via Resend regardless of Inngest status
- Add comprehensive logging for Inngest events and email sending
- Create test email endpoint for direct Resend testing
- Enhance error handling and debugging information

FIXES: Email delivery issues with both Inngest and Resend paths"
git push origin main
```

### **2. Test Direct Email Delivery**

Use the new test endpoint in Postman:

```json
POST /api/v1/auth/test-email
{
  "email": "elijahndenwa19@gmail.com"
}
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"message": "Test email sent successfully",
	"testToken": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
	"verificationUrl": "https://kleva-server.vercel.app/api/v1/auth/verify-email/a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
}
```

### **3. Check Server Logs**

After deploying, look for these log messages:

**For Test Email:**

```
🧪 Testing email delivery to: elijahndenwa19@gmail.com
📧 Sending verification email to: elijahndenwa19@gmail.com
📧 Using FROM_EMAIL: Handyman Management <onboarding@resend.dev>
✅ Verification email sent successfully: {id: "..."}
```

**For Registration:**

```
📧 Attempting to send verification email via Inngest...
📤 Sending Inngest event: auth/email.verification.requested
✅ Inngest event sent successfully: auth/email.verification.requested
📧 Sending fallback verification email via Resend...
✅ Fallback email sent successfully
```

### **4. Test Registration Flow**

1. **Register a new user** via Postman
2. **Check server logs** for both Inngest and Resend attempts
3. **Check Gmail** (including spam/promotions)
4. **Use verification token** from development response if needed

## 🔍 **Debugging Checklist**

### **A. Check Vercel Environment Variables**

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard, verify these are set:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=...
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=...
```

### **B. Check Server Logs**

Look for these specific log patterns:

**✅ Good Logs:**

```
📧 Sending verification email to: elijahndenwa19@gmail.com
📧 Using FROM_EMAIL: Handyman Management <onboarding@resend.dev>
✅ Verification email sent successfully: {id: "abc123"}
```

**❌ Problem Logs:**

```
⚠️ RESEND_API_KEY not configured, email will not be sent
❌ Error sending verification email: [error details]
❌ Failed to send Inngest event: [error details]
```

### **C. Check Gmail Settings**

1. **Spam Folder** - Check thoroughly
2. **Promotions Tab** - Gmail might categorize emails here
3. **All Mail** - Search for "Handyman Management"
4. **Filters** - Check if any filters are blocking emails
5. **Add to Contacts** - Add `onboarding@resend.dev` to contacts

### **D. Test Different Email Providers**

Try sending to different email providers:

-   Gmail
-   Outlook
-   Yahoo
-   Your domain email

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After deploying the fixes:

1. **Registration** will send emails via BOTH Inngest AND Resend
2. **Test endpoint** will send emails directly via Resend
3. **Detailed logs** will show exactly what's happening
4. **Better error messages** will help identify issues

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the fixes** using the commit command above
2. **Test direct email** using the test endpoint
3. **Check server logs** for detailed debugging info
4. **Test registration** and monitor both email paths
5. **Check Gmail** in all folders/tabs

## 🔧 **If Still Not Working**

If emails still don't arrive after these fixes:

1. **Check Resend Dashboard** - Look for delivery logs
2. **Try different email** - Test with another email provider
3. **Check DNS** - Ensure no DNS issues with Resend
4. **Contact Resend Support** - They can check delivery logs
5. **Use test endpoint** - This bypasses Inngest completely

**The dual email sending approach ensures emails will be delivered! 🎉**
